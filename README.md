# Uptown-Rental-Database-Project
This project is a MySQL relational database system built for Uptown Rentals, a startup that rents musical instruments to individual customers. The system models and manages key aspects of the business, including instrument inventory, customer information, staff roles, rentals, returns, fines, and maintenance records.

- Overview
-The database was designed using an Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) model in MySQL Workbench, then synchronized to generate and populate tables. Data was derived from sample rental records and hypothetical entries to simulate real-world use.

- Key Features
Instrument categorization by type (e.g., Strings, Woodwinds) and rental tier (e.g., Basic, Premium)

Customer registration with age, contact, and address information

Rental tracking including fees, dates, and overdue penalties

Staff management with roles and rental oversight

Maintenance logging for damaged or aging instruments

SQL queries for business reporting and analytics

 - SQL Capabilities
The project includes a .sql script (uptownRentals<YourName>.sql) with SQL programs that answer questions such as:

Who are the top customers by rental total?

Which instruments incur the most late fees?

What is the rental distribution by instrument type?

Who are the top-performing staff by rental volume?
