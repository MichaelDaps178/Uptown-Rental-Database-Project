Uptown Rentals Database Project


This project was developed as part of an academic assignment to design a relational database for a **fictional business**, *Uptown Rentals*, a startup musical instrument rental company. The goal was to replace a spreadsheet-based system with a structured database using **MySQL**.

The project includes:

- ✅ A fully normalized relational schema  
- ✅ An **Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER)** diagram created in MySQL Workbench  
- ✅ Sample data simulating real-world rentals  
- ✅ A complete set of SQL queries addressing realistic business scenarios
